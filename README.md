# WebFinancePhi
This project demonstrates the use of Phi agents, powered by Google's Gemini, to retrieve and synthesize financial and web-based information. It showcases how agent teams can be used to efficiently gather and present complex data.

It is a very simple implementation of Agentic AI , creating twi agents:
  1. WebAgent -> web search using duckduckgo
  2. Financeagent -> brings up all finance related info about a company ticker
Finally the agent thinks and summarizes all the information and returns the result
